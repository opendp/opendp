This document proves that the implementations of \rustdoc{traits/samplers/uniform/trait}{SampleUniformIntBelow} in \asOfCommit{mod.rs}{f5bb719} 
satisfy the definition of the \texttt{SampleUniformIntBelow} trait.

\begin{definition}
    \label{sample-uniform-int-below}

    The \texttt{SampleUniformIntBelow} trait defines a function \texttt{sample\_uniform\_int\_below}.

    For any setting of the input parameter \texttt{upper},
    \texttt{sample\_uniform\_int\_below} either
    \begin{itemize}
        \item raises an exception if there is a lack of system entropy,
        \item returns \texttt{out} where \texttt{out} is uniformly distributed between $[0, upper)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

There are two \texttt{impl}'s (implementations): one for unsigned integers, and one for big integers.
To prove correctness of each \texttt{impl}, we prove correctness of the implementation of \texttt{sample\_uniform\_int\_below}.

\section{\texttt{impl} for Unsigned Integers}
This corresponds to \texttt{impl SampleUniformIntBelow for \$ty} in Rust.
\texttt{sample\_uniform\_int\_below} uses rejection sampling. 
In each round, an unsigned integer is drawn uniformly at random
In each round all bits of the integer are filled randomly, drawing an unsigned integer uniformly at random.
The algorithm returns the sample, modulo the upper bound, so long as the sample is not one of the final "div" largest integers.

\subsubsection*{Preconditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User-specified types:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Variable \texttt{upper} must be of type \texttt{T}
        \item Type \texttt{T} is the type the trait is implemented for (one of u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}

\subsubsection*{Postcondition}
The postcondition is supplied by \ref{sample-uniform-int-below}.

\subsection{Proof}
\begin{proof} 
Assuming that \texttt{T.sample\_uniform\_int()} is correctly implemented,
then \texttt{v} is a sample between zero and \texttt{T.MAX} inclusive, the greatest representable number of type \texttt{T}.

You could sample one of \texttt{upper} values uniformly at random by rejecting \texttt{v} if it is larger than \texttt{upper}.
That is, only return \texttt{v} if \texttt{v} is less than \texttt{upper}.

It is equivalent to extend the acceptance region, 
by returning \texttt{v \% 2} if \texttt{v} is less than \texttt{upper * 2}, 
so long as \texttt{upper * 2 <= T.MAX}.
This reduces the rejection rate, which increases algorithm performance.

There are \texttt{T.MAX \% upper} remaining elements if you were to 
extend the acceptance region to the greatest multiple of \texttt{upper} that is less than \texttt{T.MAX}.
Therefore conditioning \texttt{v} on being less than \texttt{T.MAX - T.MAX \% upper} 
results in \texttt{v \% upper} being an unbiased, uniformly distributed sample.

\noindent Therefore, for any value of \texttt{upper}, the function satisfies the postcondition.
\end{proof}
