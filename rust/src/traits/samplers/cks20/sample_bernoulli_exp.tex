Proves soundness of \rustdoc{traits/samplers/cks20/fn}{sample\_bernoulli\_exp} in \asOfCommit{mod.rs}{0be3ab3e6}.

\texttt{fn sample\_bernoulli\_exp} returns a sample from the $Bernoulli(exp(-x))$ distribution for some rational, non-negative, finite \texttt{x}.
This proof is an adaptation of \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00010.pdf#subsection.5.1}{subsection 5.1} of \cite{CKS20}.

\subsection*{Postcondition}
\label{postcondition}
For any setting of the input parameters \texttt{x} such that the given preconditions hold, \\
\texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp} either returns \texttt{Err(e)} due to a lack of system entropy,
or \texttt{Ok(out)}, where \texttt{out} is distributed as $Bernoulli(exp(-x))$.

\section{Proof}
Assume the preconditions are met.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{err-e}
    \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp} only returns \texttt{Err(e)} when there is a lack of system entropy.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    In all invocations of \rustdoc{traits/samplers/cks20/fn}{sample\_bernoulli\_exp1}, the argument passed satisfies its definition preconditions, 
    by the preconditions on \texttt{x} and function logic.
    Thus, by its definition, \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp1} only returns an error when there is a lack of system entropy.
    The only source of errors in \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp} is from the invocation of \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp1}.
    Therefore \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp} only returns \texttt{Err(e)} when there is a lack of system entropy.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{ok-out}
    \texttt{out} is distributed as $Bernoulli(exp(-x))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    For $0 \le i \le \lfloor x \rfloor$, let $b_i$ denote the $i^{th}$ outcome of \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp1} on line \ref{line:B_i}.
    By the definition of \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp1}, under the established conditions and preconditions,
    each $B_i$ is distributed as $Bernoulli(exp(-1))$.
    Let $c$ denote the outcome of \texttt{sample\_bernoulli\_exp1} on line \ref{line:C}. 
    Similarly as before, $C$ is distributed $Bernoulli(exp(-(x - \lfloor x \rfloor)))$.

    \begin{align*}
        P[\texttt{out} = \top] &= P[B_1 = B_2 = ... = B_{\lfloor x \rfloor} = C = \top] && \text{\texttt{out} is only $\top$ if $\forall i$, $B_i = \top$ and $C = \top$} \\
        &= \prod_{i=1}^{\lfloor x \rfloor} P[B_i = \top] P[C = \top] && \text{all $B_i$ and $C$ are independent} \\
        &= exp(-1)^{\lfloor x \rfloor} exp(\lfloor x \rfloor - x) \\
        &= exp(-x)
    \end{align*}

    Therefore, \texttt{out} is distributed as $Bernoulli(exp(-x))$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}
    \ref{postcondition} holds by \ref{err-e} and \ref{ok-out}.
\end{proof}
