\subsection*{Postcondition}
For any setting of the input arguments, \texttt{sample\_geometric\_buffer} either
raises an exception if there is insufficient system entropy, 
or returns \texttt{sample} where \texttt{sample} is drawn from a discrete distribution.

\texttt{sample} is either 
\texttt{geo} where \texttt{geo} is a sample from the $Geometric(p=0.5)$ distribution, and is less than $buffer\_len * 8$, or
\texttt{None} with probability $2^{-buffer\_len * 8}$.

\begin{proof}
    \texttt{sample\_geometric\_buffer} uses \rustdoc{traits/samplers/fn}{fill\_bytes} as a subroutine to generate a buffer of $\texttt{buffer\_len}$ bytes.
    For each bit $b$ in the buffer it follows that $\Pr[b = 1] = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\Pr[b = 0] = \frac{1}{2}$. 
    If there is some bit in the buffer equal to $1$, 
    the position of the \emph{first} such bit is a zero-indexed draw from the Geometric distribution $Geom(p)$ with $p = 0.5$,
    by definition of a Geometric random variable. 
    If the buffer is zero, the function returns \texttt{None}. 
\end{proof}
