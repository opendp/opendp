This document contains materials associated with \rustdoc{accuracy/fn}{accuracy\_to\_discrete\_gaussian\_scale}.

By \rustdoc{accuracy/fn}{discrete\_gaussian\_scale\_to\_accuracy}, 
the relationship between $\alpha$, $a$ and $scale$, is:

\begin{equation*}
    \alpha = 2 \frac{e^{(1 - a)/s}}{e^{1/s} + 1}
\end{equation*}

There unfortunately isn't a closed-form expression for s.
The algorithm conducts a binary search, 
with an upper bound provided by \rustdoc{accuracy/fn}{accuracy\_to\_laplacian\_scale}.
