This document contains materials associated with \rustdoc{accuracy/fn}{accuracy\_to\_discrete\_laplacian\_scale}.

By \rustdoc{accuracy/fn}{discrete\_laplacian\_scale\_to\_accuracy}, 
the relationship between $\alpha$, $a$ and $scale$, is:

\begin{align*}
    1 - \alpha = \frac{\sum_{y=0}^{a - 1} (1 + 1[y = 0]) e^{-(y/s)^2/2}}{\sum_{z \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-(z/s)^2/2}}
\end{align*}

There unfortunately isn't a closed-form expression for s.
The algorithm conducts a binary search, 
with an upper bound provided by \rustdoc{accuracy/fn}{accuracy\_to\_laplacian\_scale}, 
to find the smallest $s$ such that

\begin{align*}
    1 - \alpha \ge \frac{\sum_{y=0}^{a - 1} (1 + 1[y = 0]) e^{-(y/s)^2/2}}{\sum_{z \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-(z/s)^2/2}}
\end{align*}
