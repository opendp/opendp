# OpenDP Changelog

This file documents the version history of OpenDP.


## [Unreleased](https://github.com/opendp/opendp/compare/stable...HEAD)

### Added
- `make_randomized_response_bool` and `make_randomized_response` for local differential privacy.
- `make_base_analytic_gaussian` for a tighter, analytic calibration of the gaussian mechanism.  
- `make_population_amplification` combinator for privacy amplification by subsampling.
- `make_drop_null` transformation for dropping null values in nullish data.
- `make_find`, `make_find_bin` and `make_index` transformations for categorical relabeling and binning.
- `make_base_alp` for histograms via approximate laplace projections from Christian Lebeda (https://github.com/ChristianLebeda)
- `make_base_ptr` for stability histograms via propose-test-release.
- Added floating-point numbers to the admissible output types on integer queries like `make_count`, `make_count_by`, `make_count_by_categories` and `make_count_distinct`.
- Simple attack notebook from Oren Renard (https://github.com/orespo)
- Support for Numpy data types.

### Fixed
- Resolved memory leaks in FFI

### Changed
- moved windows patch directory into `/rust`
- added minimum rust version of 1.56 and updated to the 2021 edition.
- dropped sized-ness domain requirements from `make_count_by`

### Security
- `make_base_stability` underestimated the sensitivity of queries. Removed in favor of `make_base_ptr`.
- Floating-point arithmetic throughout the library now has explicit rounding modes such that the budget is always slightly overestimated. There is still some potential for small floating-point leaks via rounding in floating-point aggregations.
- Fixed integer truncation issue in the sized bounded sum privacy relation.
- The resize relation is now looser to account for a worst-case situation where d_in records removed, and d_in new records are imputed.
