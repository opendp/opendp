name: New mechanism
about: Solicit feedback for a contribution you'd like to make
---

For a new mechanism:
- Link to the research paper(s) and/or existing implementation your contribution will be based on
- Make a case for why this mechanism should be added to the library:
  - Is it unique and does it have reasonable utility?
  - If it has a similar behavior as another mechanism, can you show that it has greater utility or useful trade-offs?
