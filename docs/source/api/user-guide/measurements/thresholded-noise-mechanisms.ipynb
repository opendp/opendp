    "## Distribution: Laplace vs. Gaussian\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplace mechanism is used to privatize an aggregate, like a sum or mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of the Laplace threshold mechanism is captured by a _measurement_ containing the following five elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Elements of a Laplace Threshold Measurement</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first define the **function** $f(\\cdot)$, that applies the Laplace mechanism to the values of $x$, \n",
    "and then discards pairs whose value is below the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def f(x: dict[Any, float]) -> dict[Any, float]:\n",
    "        x = {k: Laplace(mu=v, b=scale) for k, v in x.items()}\n",
    "        return {k: v for k, v in x.items() if v >= threshold}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Importantly, $f(\\cdot)$ is only well-defined for any dictionary with finite float values. This set of permitted inputs is described by the **input domain** (denoted `MapDomain<AtomDomain<TK>, AtomDomain<f64>>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Laplace threshold mechanism has a privacy guarantee in terms of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. \n",
    "This guarantee is represented by a **privacy map**, a function that computes the greatest privacy loss $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ for any choice of sensitivity $\\Delta_0, \\Delta_1, \\Delta_\\infty$. The privacy map is roughly implemented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def map(d_in):\n",
    "        l0, l1, li = d_in\n",
    "        epsilon = l1 / scale\n",
    "\n",
    "        # probability of sampling a noise value greater than: threshold - li\n",
    "        delta_single = tail(scale, threshold - li)\n",
    "        delta = 1 - (1 - delta_single)**l0\n",
    "        return epsilon, delta\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This map only promises that the privacy loss will be at most $\\epsilon$ if inputs from any two neighboring datasets may differ by no more than some quantity $\\Delta_0, \\Delta_1, \\Delta_\\infty$ under the absolute distance **input metric** (`L01InfDistance<AbsoluteDistance<f64>>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We similarly describe units on the output ($(\\epsilon, \\delta)$) via the **output measure** (`Approximate<MaxDivergence>`).\n",

    "The \"continuous\" Laplace and Gaussian measurements convert their float values to a rational representation, and then add integer noise to the numerator via the respective discrete distribution. \n",
    "In the OpenDP Library's default configuration, this rational representation of a float is exact.\n",
    "Therefore the privacy analysis is as tight as if you were to sample truly continuous noise and then postprocess by rounding to the nearest float. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most use-cases the sampling algorithm is sufficiently fast when the rational representation is exact.\n",
    "That is, when noise is sampled with a granularity of $2^{-1074}$, the same granularity as the distance between subnormal 64-bit floats.\n",
    "However, the granularity can be adjusted to $2^k$, for some choice of k, for a faster runtime.\n",
