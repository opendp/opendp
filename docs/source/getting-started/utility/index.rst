Assessing Utility
=================

The laplace and gaussian mechanisms offer different trade-offs between privacy and utility:
Each is appropriate for specific tasks.

Finally, in tutorials we'll often compare the true statistics to the DP versions
to develop an intuition about the accuracy of DP.
Obviously, in production we can't actually look at the true values,
but OpenDP does offer utilties to calculate the accuracy.
