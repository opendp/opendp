Quickstart
==========

OpenDP is available for Python, R, and Rust.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Python
        :sync: python

        Use ``pip`` to install the `opendp <https://pypi.org/project/opendp/>`_ package from PyPI:

        .. prompt:: bash

            pip install opendp

    .. tab-item:: R
        :sync: r

        Launch R and then use ``install.packages``:

        .. code:: r

            install.packages('opendp', repos = 'https://opendp.r-universe.dev/')

    .. tab-item:: Rust
        :sync: rust

        In a new directory run ``cargo init`` and then specify OpenDP as a dependency in ``Cargo.toml``:

        .. literalinclude:: quickstart.rs
            :language: toml
            :start-after: init
            :end-before: /init


This will make the OpenDP modules available to your local environment.

The vetting process is currently underway for the code in the OpenDP Library.
Any code that has not completed the vetting process is marked as "contrib" and will not run unless you opt-in.
Enable ``contrib`` globally with the following snippet:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Python
        :sync: python

        .. literalinclude:: quickstart-context.rst
            :language: python
            :start-after: init
            :end-before: /init

    .. tab-item:: R
        :sync: r

        .. literalinclude:: quickstart.R
            :language: r
            :start-after: init
            :end-before: /init

    .. tab-item:: Rust
        :sync: rust

        In Rust, ``contrib`` is specified in ``Cargo.toml``.


Once you've installed OpenDP, you can write your first program.
Let's apply Laplace noise to a value.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Python
        :sync: python

        .. literalinclude:: quickstart-context.rst
            :language: python
            :start-after: demo
            :end-before: /demo

    .. tab-item:: R
        :sync: r

        .. literalinclude:: quickstart.R
            :language: r
            :start-after: demo
            :end-before: /demo

    .. tab-item:: Rust
        :sync: rust

        .. literalinclude:: quickstart.rs
            :language: rust
            :start-after: demo
            :end-before: /demo

This is obviously not the easiest way to add noise to a number,
but it demonstrates a number of OpenDP patterns:

* Defining your metric space with ``space_of`` in Python's Context API, or a (domain, distance) tuple in any language..
* Chaining operators together with ``>>`` in Python and Rust, or ``|>`` in R.
* Constructing a ``Measurement`` function on your metric space with ``then_laplace``.
* Invoking that measurement on a value to get a DP release.
