    "Before we get into the different types of composition, let's understand why composition is important and what it means. We will rarely only want one differentially private statistic; instead, we will compute multiple statistics on the same dataset. \n",

    "If we run many different differentially private algorithms on the same dataset, the resulting **composed** algorithm is also differentially private. So composition is a useful tool because it enables us to analyze the privacy properties of algorithms designed in this way. "

    "**Noninteractive**: All queries are composed and executed at once. Specifically, take $F$ as a noninteractive algorithm composed of individual queries $F = \\text{Comp}(F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_{k-1})$ and dataset x as the input dataset. $F(x)$ is our output, an algorithm that executes all the queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive**: In an interactive algorithm, the queries are not defined in advance, and they can be determined based on the results from previous queries. This is an **adaptive** scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interactivity can be viewed as a superset that includes another kind of variation: non-adaptive, adaptive, or concurrent. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **non-adaptive** scenario is where you simply want to compute statistics such as the mean, median, and sum of particular columns in a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An **adaptive** scenario allows you to choose the next query after releasing the previous query. For example, analysis begins with computing particular statistics about a column, such as \"income,\" and then later queries depend on the results from the prior queries. For example, if you notice that the mean and median are extremely different, you may explore the distribution of the data. Otherwise, you may choose to focus your queries on other, more interesting aspects of your data. However, adaptive queries cannot be run concurrently and have a sequential constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent** composition addresses this limitation. There is ongoing research about this mechanism. \n",

    "Interactive differential privacy is considered the \"right\" modeling for many applications since it is required for implementing many DP mechanisms such as the Sparse Vector Technique. \n",
