Next Steps
==========

This has only been a quick tour of the OpenDP Library.
Everything we've touched on here is explained in more detail in the API User Guide:

* For more on using Polars in OpenDP, see :ref:`expression-index`.
* For a deeper explanation of how to combine multiple queries, see :ref:`compositors`.
* Or if you're interested in extending OpenDP with your own algorithms, see :ref:`plugins`.

Finally, if you have ideas for how we could improve this documentation,
please let us know at `info@opendp.org <mailto:info@opendp.org>`_.
