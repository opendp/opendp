    "A LaTex macro is mentioned below that generates the expected postconditions for transformation and measurement constructors.\n",

    "```rust\n",
    "/// # Proof Definition\n",
    "/// For any setting of the input parameters, \n",
    "/// returns either `Ok(out)` where $out \\ge |a - b|$, or `Err(e)`.\n",

    "    a.inf_sub(&b)?.alerting_abs()\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "`inf_sub` is provided by the `InfSub` trait, and it computes the subtraction of `b` from `a`. By the proof definition of `InfSub`, if the outcome is not exactly representable in `T`, then the outcome is rounded towards positive infinity, to the nearest value in `T` (think of when `T` is float and arithmetic is not closed). \n",
    "\n",
    "Again by the proof definition of `InfSub`, `inf_sub` returns an error if the computation overflows. \n",
    "The type of things that *might* be an error is `Fallible<T>`, which is an enum containing either `Ok(value)`, where `value` is of type `T`, or `Err(e)`, where `e` is the error details (backtrace, message, debug info).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `inf_sub` and `alerting_abs` return a value of type `Fallible<T>`.\n",
    "After calling `inf_sub`, the question mark exits the function early with the error, if there is one, otherwise execution continues to `alerting_abs` with the value of type `T` stored inside the `Ok` variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the function expects a return of type `Fallible<T>`.\n",
    "This is consistent with the two return sites of the function: the question mark after `inf_sub`, and the implicit return of the outcome of `alerting_abs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reading code in Rust for proof purposes, you can generally ignore references (`&`), dereferences (`*`, not multiplication) and clones (`.clone()`).\n",
    "We consider these aspects of the code proven by the Rust compiler."
