Development Environment
=======================

Follow the steps below to get an OpenDP development environment set up, including the ability to run tests in both Rust and Python.

* Install the `Rust toolchain <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`_.
* Install `Python version 3.6 or higher <https://www.python.org>`_.


Clone the OpenDP Repo
---------------------

If you don't have write access to the OpenDP repository, you will either need to request to join the organization or make a fork.
`The GitHub documentation explains forking <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_.

Clone the repo (or your fork) and change into the ``opendp`` directory that's created.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:opendp/opendp.git
    cd opendp


If you have not `set up SSH <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_, you can clone with https instead:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/opendp/opendp.git


Build OpenDP
============

Next, you'll need to build the Rust binaries. 
This is done by running ``cargo build`` in the ``rust`` subdirectory of the repo:
Change to the ``rust`` directory before attempting a build, run the tests, and then return to the ``opendp`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd rust
    cargo build --features untrusted,bindings-python
    cargo test --features untrusted,bindings-python
    cd ..

This will compile a debug version of the OpenDP shared library, placing it in the directory ``opendp/rust/target/debug``. (The specific name of the library file will vary depending on your platform.)
Features are optional. Setting a feature changes how the crate compiles:

   * - Name
     - Description
   * - ``untrusted``
     - Enables untrusted features ``contrib`` and ``floating-point``.
   * - ``contrib``
     - Enable to include constructors that have not passed the vetting process.
   * - ``floating-point``
     - Enable to include measurements with floating-point vulnerabilities.
   * - ``bindings-python``
     - Enables the ``ffi`` feature and regenerates sources in the python package.
   * - ``ffi``
     - Enable to include C foreign function interfaces.
   * - ``use-system-libs``
     - Enable to use the system installation of MPFR.
   * - ``use-mpfr``
     - Already enabled. Use MPFR for exact floating-point arithmetic.
   * - ``use-openssl``
     - Already enabled. Use OpenSSL for secure noise generation.

If you run into compilation problems, please contact us!
We also have a :ref:`developer-faq` with some common issues. 

.. note::

    There is a more involved `setup guide <https://github.com/opendp/opendp/tree/main/rust/windows>`_ for Windows users.
    You can compromise to simple and vulnerable builds instead, by adding the ``--no-default-features`` flag to cargo commands.
    Be advised this flag disables GMP's exact float handling, as well as OpenSSL's secure noise generation.


Python Setup
------------

Finally, you can install a local Python package that uses your new shared library. 
This is possible by using ``pip install`` with the ``-e`` option in the ``python`` subdirectory.

We recommend setting up a virtual environment first, but this is optional:

.. raw:: html

   <details style="margin:-1em 0 2em 2em">
   <summary><a>Virtual Environment</a></summary>

.. code-block:: bash

    # recommended. conda is just as valid
    python3 -m venv opendp
    source opendp/bin/activate

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Change to the ``python`` directory, install dependencies, and then install the Python OpenDP library itself.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd python

    pip install flake8 pytest
    pip install -e .

The `-e` flag is significant! It stands for "editable", meaning you only have to run this command once.
At this point, you should be able use OpenDP as a locally installed package. 


Testing Python
--------------
You can test that things are working by running OpenDP's python test suite, using ``pytest``:
Run the tests from the ``python`` directory. 

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -v

If everything has gone well, you'll see a bunch of output, then a line similar to this:

.. prompt:: bash

    ================== 57 passed in 1.02s ==================

If pytest is not found, don't forget to activate your virtual environment!

This is just a quick overview of building OpenDP. If you're interested in porting OpenDP to a different platform, we'd be delighted to get your help; please :doc:`contact us <../contact>`!

Documentation
=============

The source for this documentation can be found in the "docs" directory at https://github.com/opendp/opendp

Building the Docs
-----------------

The docs are built using Sphinx and the steps are listed in the README in the "docs" directory.


Tooling
=======

There are many development environments that work with Rust. Here are a few:

* `VS Code <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer>`_
* `Intellij IDEA <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust>`_
* `Sublime <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-enhanced>`_

Use whatever developer tooling you are comfortable with.


A few notes on VS Code:

* Be sure to install the `rust-analyzer <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer>`_ plugin, not the rust plugin
* Open ``rust-analyzer``'s extension settings, search "features" and add ``"untrusted", "bindings-python"``
* Look for ``Problems`` in the bottom panel for live compilation errors as you work
* Other useful extensions are "Better Toml", "crates" and "LaTex Workshop".
* Starter json configurations:

These tasks can be used to directly build OpenDP.

A few notes on Intellij IDEA:

* Both the Intellij IDEA community edition and the CodeWithMe plugin are free
* Be sure to open the project at the root of the git repository
* Be sure to install the Python and Rust plugins for interactivity
* Be sure to "attach" the Cargo.toml in the red banner the first time you open a Rust source file
* Use run configurations to `build the rust library <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/cargo-command-configuration.html#cargo-command-config>`_ and run tests
