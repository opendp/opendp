Parameter Search
----------------

There are many parameters in a typical DP measurement:

* ``d_in`` input distance (oftentimes how many records differ when you perturb one individual)
* ``d_out`` output distance (oftentimes the privacy budget)
* noise scale or other parameters passed to the constructors

To evaluate a relation, you must fix all of these parameters.
The relation simply returns a boolean indicating if it passed.

As alluded to in the :ref:`relations` section,
if the relation passes for a given ``d_out``, it will also pass for any value greater than ``d_out``.

This behavior makes it possible to solve for any one parameter using a binary search
because the relation itself acts as your predicate function.
This is extremely powerful!

* | If you have a bound on ``d_in`` and a noise scale, you can solve for the tightest budget ``d_out`` that is still differentially private.
  | This is useful when you want to find the smallest budget that will satisfy a target accuracy.
* | If you have a bound on ``d_in`` and a budget ``d_out``, you can solve for the smallest noise scale that is still differentially private.
  | This is useful when you want to determine how accurate you can make a query with a given budget.
* | If you have a noise scale and a budget ``d_out``, you can solve for the smallest bound on ``d_in`` that is still differentially private.
  | This is useful when you want to determine an upper bound on how many records can be collected from an individual before needing to truncate.
* | If you have ``d_in``, ``d_out``, and noise scale derived from a target accuracy and want to find the smallest dataset size ``n`` that is still differentially private.
  | This is useful when you want to determine the necessary sample size when collecting data.
* | If you have ``d_in``, ``d_out``, and noise scale derived from a target accuracy and want to find the greatest clipping range that is still differentially private
  | This is useful when you want to minimize the likelihood of introducing bias.

OpenDP comes with some utility functions to make these binary searches easier to conduct:

* :func:`opendp.mod.binary_search_chain`: Pass it a function that makes a chain from one numeric argument, as well as ``d_in`` and ``d_out``. Returns the tightest chain.
* :func:`opendp.mod.binary_search_param`: Same as binary_search_chain, but returns the discovered parameter.
* :func:`opendp.mod.binary_search`: Pass a predicate function and bounds. Returns the discovered parameter. Useful when you just want to solve for ``d_in`` or ``d_out``.


.. _determining-accuracy:

Determining Accuracy
--------------------

The library contains utilities to estimate accuracy at a given noise scale and statistical significance level
or derive the necessary noise scale to meet a given target accuracy and statistical significance level.

The noise scale may be either laplace or gaussian.

:laplacian: | Applies to any L1 noise addition mechanism.
  | :func:`make_base_laplace() <opendp.meas.make_base_laplace>`
  | :func:`make_base_geometric() <opendp.meas.make_base_geometric>`
  | :func:`make_base_stability(MI=L1Distance[T]) <opendp.meas.make_base_stability>`
:gaussian: | Applies to any L2 noise addition mechanism.
  | :func:`make_base_gaussian() <opendp.meas.make_base_gaussian>`
  | :func:`make_base_stability(MI=L2Distance[T]) <opendp.meas.make_base_stability>`

The library provides the following functions for converting to and from noise scales:

* :func:`opendp.accuracy.laplacian_scale_to_accuracy`
* :func:`opendp.accuracy.accuracy_to_laplacian_scale`
* :func:`opendp.accuracy.gaussian_scale_to_accuracy`
* :func:`opendp.accuracy.accuracy_to_gaussian_scale`

These functions take either scale or accuracy, and alpha, a statistical significance parameter.

You can generally plug the distribution, scale, accuracy and alpha
into the following statement to interpret these functions:

.. code-block:: python

    f"When the {distribution} scale is {scale}, "
    f"the DP estimate differs from the true value by no more than {accuracy} "
    f"at a statistical significance level alpha of {alpha}, "
    f"or with (1 - {alpha})100% = {(1 - alpha) * 100}% confidence."


.. _putting-together:

Putting It Together
-------------------

Let's say we want to compute the DP mean, along with a 95% confident accuracy estimate, of a dataset of student exam scores.
With the public knowledge that the class only has three exams,
we know each student may contribute at most three records, so ``d_in`` is 3.
We have a privacy budget of one-epsilon, therefore ``d_out`` will be 1.

Referencing the :ref:`transformation-constructors` section, first we'll need to cast, impute, clamp and resize.

Then we'll aggregate and chain with a :func:`opendp.meas.make_base_laplace` measurement.

Referencing the :ref:`parameter-search` section, :func:`opendp.mod.binary_search_param`
will help us find a noise scale parameter that satisfies our given budget.
Referencing the :ref:`determining-accuracy` section, :func:`opendp.accuracy.laplace_scale_to_accuracy`
can be used to convert this discovered noise scale parameter to an accuracy estimate.
