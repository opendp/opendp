What is OpenDP?
---------------

`OpenDP`_ is a community effort to build trustworthy, open source software tools for statistical analysis of sensitive private data using `differential privacy`_.

.. _differential privacy: https://opendp.org/about#whatisdifferentialprivacy

Various tools build upon the `OpenDP library`_ and are known (along with the library itself) as the :doc:`/opendp-commons/index`. The OpenDP library and examples of these tools are shown in the diagram below.
