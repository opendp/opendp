- title: Accuracy
  desc: The `accuracy` module provides functions for converting between accuracy and scale parameters.
  contents:
  - has_concept("accuracy")

- title: Combinators
  desc: The `combinators` module provides functions for combining transformations and measurements.
  contents:
  - has_concept("combinators")

- title: Core
  desc: The `core` module provides functions for accessing the fields of transformations and measurements.
  contents:
  - has_concept("core")

- title: Domains
  desc: The `domains` module provides functions for creating and using domains.
  contents:
  - has_concept("domains")

- title: Measurements
  desc: The `measurements` module provides functions that apply calibrated noise to data to ensure differential privacy.
  contents:
  - has_concept("measurements")

- title: Measures
  desc: The `measures` modules provides functions that measure the distance between probability distributions.
  contents:
  - has_concept("measures")

- title: Metrics
  desc: The `metrics` module provides fuctions that measure the distance between two elements of a domain.
  contents:
  - has_concept("metrics")

- title: Mod
  desc: |
    The `mod` module provides the classes which implement the [OpenDP Programming Framework](https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/api/user-guide/programming-framework/index.html),
    as well as utilities for enabling features and finding parameter values.
  contents:
  - has_concept("mod")

- title: Transformations
  desc: The `transformations` module provides functions that deterministicly transform datasets.
  contents:
  - has_concept("transformations")

- title: Typing
  desc: |
    The `typing` module provides utilities that bridge between R and Rust types.
    OpenDP relies on precise descriptions of data types to make its security guarantees:
    These are more natural in Rust with its fine-grained type system, but they may feel out of place in R.
    These utilities try to fill that gap.
