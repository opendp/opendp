    This executes an Îµ-DP mechanism M that returns a tuple (q, x) repeatedly
    until the score q is at least T, a predefined threshold.
    Only the last output of M is released.

    Algorithm 1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07971.pdf#page=7

    :param meas: A measurement function that returns a 2-tuple when invoked,
                 where the first element is a score.
    :param threshold: The threshold score. Return immediately if the score is above this threshold.
    :param stop_probability: The probability of stopping early at any iteration.
    :param epsilon_selection: The epsilon allocated to the private selection.
    :param steps: Optional. The number of steps to run. If not specified, will run the minimum number of steps.
    :returns: A tuple from `meas` with the first element being the score.
