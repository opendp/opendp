'''
This module requires extra installs: ``pip install 'opendp[mbi]'``

``mbi`` is short for "marginal-based inference", 
and is the name of the `Private-PGM <https://github.com/ryan112358/private-pgm>`_ package.
OpenDP uses Private-PGM to postprocess DP releases made with the OpenDP Library.

For convenience, all the functions of this module are also available from :py:mod:`opendp.prelude`.
We suggest importing under the conventional name ``dp``:

.. code:: python

    >>> import opendp.prelude as dp

The methods of this module will then be accessible at ``dp.mbi``.
