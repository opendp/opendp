    A number of opendp functions rely on optional dependencies.
    If a user calls one of these functions without the appropriate installs,
    we want to be sure there is always a helpful error message.
    To that end, we should:
    - Make sure the test suite runs for any set of optional dependencies.
    - Avoid pytest.skipif: There is always a defined behavior to check.
    - If the test uses a dependency indirectly,
      wrap the first call with "with optional_dependency('numpy'):" or similar
    - If the test uses a library directly,
      use "np = pytest.importorskip('numpy')" as late in the code as possible,
      so we can catch any preceding indirect usages.

    If "optional_dependency('numpy')" and "pytest.importorskip('numpy')"
    are used in the same test, it is redundant, but doesn't do any harm.
