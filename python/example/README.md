## Python Notebooks
The following notebooks show how to use the OpenDP library through the Python bindings.

* [`basic_data_analysis.ipynb`](basic_data_analysis.ipynb) A brief tutorial of data analysis with the OpenDP library.
* [`histograms.ipynb`](histograms.ipynb) A tour of algorithms to release histograms on integer, string and boolean variables.
* [`unknown_dataset_size.ipynb`](unknown_dataset_size.ipynb) Learn how to use statistical estimators that require a known dataset size in situations where dataset size is unknown.
* [`accuracy_pitfalls.ipynb`](accuracy_pitfalls.ipynb) Demonstrates how DP confidence intervals can be misleading.
* [`attack_simple.ipynb`](attack_simple.ipynb): Demonstrates a simple attack on traditional, non-private data releases.
* [`attack_membership.ipynb`](attack_membership.ipynb): Demonstrates a membership attack. Such an attack can identify if an individual is present in the private dataset.
* [`attack_reconstruction.ipynb`](attack_reconstruction.ipynb): Demonstrates a reconstruction attack. Such an attack can reconstruct the data used in a release.
