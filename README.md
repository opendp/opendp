The OpenDP Library is a modular collection of statistical algorithms that adhere to the definition of
[differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy).
It can be used to build applications of privacy-preserving computations, using a number of different models of privacy.
OpenDP is implemented in Rust, with bindings for easy use from Python and R.

The architecture of the OpenDP Library is based on a conceptual framework for expressing privacy-aware computations.
This framework is described in the paper [A Programming Framework for OpenDP](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/opendp/files/opendp_programming_framework_11may2020_1_01.pdf).

The OpenDP Library is part of the larger [OpenDP Project](https://opendp.org), a community effort to build trustworthy,
open source software tools for analysis of private data.
(For simplicity in these docs, when we refer to “OpenDP,” we mean just the library, not the entire project.)

## Status

OpenDP is under development, and we expect to [release new versions](https://github.com/opendp/opendp/releases) frequently,
incorporating feedback and code contributions from the OpenDP Community.
It's a work in progress, but it can already be used to build some applications and to prototype contributions that will expand its functionality.
We welcome you to try it and look forward to feedback on the library! However, please be aware of the following limitations:

> OpenDP, like all real-world software, has both known and unknown issues.
> If you intend to use OpenDP for a privacy-critical application, you should evaluate the impact of these issues on your use case.
> 
> More details can be found in the [Limitations section of the User Guide](https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/api/user-guide/limitations.html).


## Installation

Install OpenDP for Python with `pip` (the [package installer for Python](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)):

    $ pip install opendp

Install OpenDP for R from an R session:

    install.packages("opendp", repos = "https://opendp.r-universe.dev")

More information can be found in the [Getting Started section of the User Guide](https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/getting-started/).
