Utilities
=========

There are few utilities that may be useful.

* Use the :doc:`typing` module to manage the data types in the computation chain
* Use :doc:`parameter-search` to find free parameters in a computation chain
* Use :doc:`serialization` to transformation OpenDP objects into strings, and back to objects
