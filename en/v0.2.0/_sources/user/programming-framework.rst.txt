OpenDP is based on a model described in the paper `A Programming Framework for OpenDP <https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/opendp/files/opendp_programming_framework_11may2020_1_01.pdf>`_. This framework lays out a rigorous approach to modeling privacy-preserving computations. OpenDP (the software library) is a faithful implementation of the OpenDP Programming Framework. This allows you to create applications with well-defined privacy characteristics.
