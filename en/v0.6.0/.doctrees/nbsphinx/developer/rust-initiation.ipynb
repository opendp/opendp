    "The input and output domains strictly define the set of permissible input and output values.\n",
    "Examples of metrics are `AllDomain`, `VectorDomain`, `MapDomain` and `DataFrameDomain`. \n",
    "When you attempt to chain any two transformations, the output domain of the first transformation must match the input domain of the second transformation ([via the PartialEq trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html)).\n",
