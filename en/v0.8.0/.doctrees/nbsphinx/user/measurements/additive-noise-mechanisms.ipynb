    "## Distribution: Laplace vs. Gaussian\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplace mechanism is a ubiquitous algorithm in the DP ecosystem that is used to privatize an aggregate, like a sum or mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of the Laplace mechanism is captured by a _measurement_ containing the following five elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Elements of a Laplace Measurement</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first define the **function** $f(\\cdot)$, that applies the Laplace mechanism to some argument $x$. This function simply samples from the Laplace distribution centered at $x$, with a fixed noise scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = Laplace(\\mu=x, b=scale)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Importantly, $f(\\cdot)$ is only well-defined for any finite float input. This set of permitted inputs is described by the **input domain** (denoted `AtomDomain<f64>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Laplace mechanism has a privacy guarantee in terms of epsilon. \n",
    "This guarantee is represented by a **privacy map**, a function that computes the privacy loss $\\epsilon$ for any choice of sensitivity $\\Delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$map(\\Delta) = \\Delta / scale <= \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This map only promises that the privacy loss will be at most $\\epsilon$ if inputs from any two neighboring datasets may differ by no more than some quantity $\\Delta$ under the absolute distance **input metric** (`AbsoluteDistance<f64>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We similarly describe units on the output ($\\epsilon$) via the **output measure** (`MaxDivergence<f64>`).\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `make_base_laplace` constructor function returns the equivalent of the Laplace measurement described above."
