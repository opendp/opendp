Contributor License Agreement
=============================

Thank you for your interest in working on OpenDP!
The OpenDP Project requires contributors to complete a Contributor License Agreement before we can accept your submissions.
This ensures that we have the proper permission to incorporate your work.

Depending on your situation — whether you are contributing as an individual, or in your work for a company — you should
select one of the options below.
This will take you to a page with instructions for completing the agreement.

Please read the agreement carefully, as it specifies your rights and responsibilities.
If you have any questions about this agreement, please contact us at info@opendp.org.
